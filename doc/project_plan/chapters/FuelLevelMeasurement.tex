\chapter{Fuel Level Measurement}

The fuel level measurement is implemented by means of a voltage divider

The sensor in the fuel tank is a variable resistor whose value varies from 0 to infinite as the fuel level goes from full to empty, as is shown in Table~\ref{tab:fuelresistance}

The factory service manual indicates that the resistance will vary according to the following table.
