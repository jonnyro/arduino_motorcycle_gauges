\chapter{Fuel Level Measurement}

The fuel level measurement is implemented by means of a voltage divider\cite{some_voltage_divider_ref}.

The sensor in the fuel tank is a variable resistor whose value varies from 0 to infinite as the fuel level goes from full to empty.

The factory service manual indicates that the resistance will vary according to the following table.
